# IRISight: Iris Image Recognition for Eye Disease Diagnosis
This project aims to leverage the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to develop a predictive model that can accurately diagnose various iris-related diseases. By analyzing iris images, we can unlock valuable insights and patterns that aid in early detection and prompt treatment, ultimately improving the quality of eye healthcare.



## Features
Iris Image Classification: The project employs advanced machine learning algorithms to classify iris images into different disease categories, including but not limited to cataracts, glaucoma, iris melanoma, and diabetic retinopathy.

Prediction Accuracy: The algorithms have been trained on a vast dataset of labeled iris images, ensuring high prediction accuracy. Extensive testing and validation have been conducted to ensure reliable results.

User-Friendly Interface: The application provides a user-friendly interface that allows healthcare professionals to upload iris images easily. The software processes the images promptly and presents the diagnosis or prediction results in a clear and understandable format.

Interactive Visualization: The project incorporates interactive visualizations to display various characteristics of the iris images, helping healthcare professionals gain insights into the diagnostic process and aiding in decision-making.

Integration with Existing Systems: The Iris Disease Diagnosis and Prediction application can be seamlessly integrated into existing healthcare systems, making it convenient for healthcare professionals to incorporate iris disease analysis into their routine workflow.
